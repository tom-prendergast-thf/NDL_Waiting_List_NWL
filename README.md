# Networked Data Lab (NDL) - North West London (NWL)
## Topic 5: Waiting Lists 

The NWL team is one of the five analytical teams funded by the Health Foundation NDL collaborative network. 

For Topic 5, the team set to capture a snapshot of the state of elective waiting lists in NWL and to explore factors that affect patient experience both of waiting for healthcare and post-care outcomes.
 

## Key Research Questions

The analyses focused on investigating the following overarching research questions:

* Who are those citizens on our NHS waiting lists? What are their demographics and health needs?
* What procedures are they waiting for and for how long?
* What happens to healthcare utilisation whilst people are waiting for treatment?

By engaging with local stakeholders, hip replacements and cardiothoracic surgery were chosen for deep-dive analysis.

## Study Design

The descriptive portions of this study employ a retrospective cohort design to explore the wait lengths, pathway outcomes, and various health and demographic breakdowns of the elective care waiting list. 

The causal portion uses a difference-in-difference study design to assess the effect of waiting for longer than target periods of time on healthcare use and costs for hip replacements and cardiothoracic surgery.
